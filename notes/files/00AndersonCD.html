<P>
I am assuming that audience members have a
good grip on graduate level algebra, particularly of the linear sort,
and are familiar with curve technology up to and including adeles and
the Riemann-Roch theorem.  I am *not* assuming any familiarity with
mathematical physics or representation theory. As advertised, I'm
trying to pitch this material to people who already feel at home in
number theory.
</P>

<P>
As far as preliminary reading goes, the
list of references on the project description may be helpful.  But
again, let me emphasize that knowing one's way around the Riemann-Roch
theorem and the adele technology is the main thing.
</P>

<P>
I'm trying *really* hard to make this gentle and accessible. Perhaps I
have gone too far in my quest to turn class field theory and abelian
function theory into patterned matrix manipulation....

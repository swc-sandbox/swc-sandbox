			<H3>Rough outline of lectures</H3>
<P>
In the lectures we will discuss how a family of varieties gives rise to a
variation of Hodge structures (Lecture 1). In Lecture 2 we discuss
examples of variations of Hodge structure coming from certain explicit
families of curves. In Lecture 3 we discuss a family of surfaces and its
associated variation of Hodge structures. A common feature of the examples
of Lectures 2 and 3 will be the existence of a Shimura variety parametrizing
the geometric objects. In the final lecture we describe the variation of
Hodge structure on H<sup>3</sup> of a family of threefolds and we formulate a
question which will hopefully be addressed by the students.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<P>
Everybody should know what a Hodge structure is (this will not be
explained in the lectures). There are several kinds; for us <b>Z</b>-Hodge
structures and <b>Q</b>-Hodge structures will be the important ones. Students should
know what a morphism of Hodge structures is, and how to take tensor
products of Hodge structures, duals etc. It is also important
to know what a polarization of a Hodge structure is.
</P><P>
Everybody should know what an algebraic variety is, and what a family of
varieties is. (This will not be explained in the lectures.)
</p><P>
Useful to know: The cohomology on a nonsingular complex projective
variety carries a natural polarizable Hodge structure. An abelian variety
corresponds to a polarizable <b>Z</b>-Hodge structure of weight 1.
</P>
<H3>References</H3>
<P>This is a little tricky since I do not know a short
introduction to Hodge structures. You really don't have to know Hodge
theory, you just have to know what a Hodge structure is. You can look at
the original articles by Deligne, Griffiths for example. There is a book
by Fouad El Zein ``Introduction &agrave; la th&eacute;orie de Hodge mixte'' where
you can find the definitions in Section 1.2. You can also look at
Wells, R. O., Jr. Differential analysis on complex manifolds. Second
edition. Graduate Texts in Mathematics, 65. Springer-Verlag, New
York-Berlin, 1980. In general talking about Hodge structures with your
friends might be a good preparation for this course.</P>

<H3>Project description</H3>
<P>
We will take a particular variation of Hodge structures corresponding to a
family of threefolds and we will try to determine whether the Hodge
structures in question ever are reducible. This will be related to
geometrical questions on the 3-folds and we will try to solve those instead. 
As an experiment, to guess the answers, we are going to do
some counting of points on the 3-folds modulo <i>p</i>! (At least if there are
any students who know how to use computers to count points in finite
fields having <i>p</i>, <i>p</i><sup>2</sup>,... elements.)
</P>

<P>
I may have to find another (related) project as this one may be too hard.

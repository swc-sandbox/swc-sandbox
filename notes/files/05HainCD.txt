The topic of my lectures will be:An introduction to the mixed Hodge structure on the fundamental groupof a smooth variety.In these, I will:* give an introduction to mixed Hodge structures (MHSs) and theirextensions (unless you tell me that this is unnecessary).* give an introduction to Chen's iterated integrals and prove his pi_1de Rham theorem. This will include a discussion of polylogs.* sketch the construction of the MHS on the fundamental group of a smoothquasi-projective variety, and give the construction in detail in the case of an open subset of P^n.* give a very brief introduction to limits MHS on fundamental groups --- mainly focused on P^1 - {0,1,infty}. This will include a discussion ofasymptotic base points.* give a computation of the extensions that appear in the limit MHS on thepolylog variation of MHS over P^1 -{0,1,infty}. This will include a discussion of the Drinfeld associator and mixed zeta numbers.A good introductory reference is:Richard M.

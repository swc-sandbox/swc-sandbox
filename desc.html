<H2>The Southwest Center for Arithmetic Geometry</H2>
<P>
  The Southwest Center for Arithmetic Geometry was founded in 1997 by
  seven mathematicians working in the southwest: Alex Buium, Minhyong
  Kim, Bill McCallum, Wayne Raskind, Dinesh Thakur, Doug Ulmer, and
  Felipe Voloch.  They were joined in 2002 by Michael Nakamaye, Bjorn
  Poonen, and Fernando Rodriguez-Villegas.  The current directors are
  Matt Papanikolas, David Savitt, William Stein, Dinesh Thakur and
  Fernando Rodriguez Villegas.  The Center is funded by the National
  Science Foundation, and its activities include the annual Arizona
  Winter School and a distinguished lecture series.

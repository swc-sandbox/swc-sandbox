	<h1 class="header">Local Directions for AWS 2015</h1>
	  <h2>Locations</h2>
	  
	  <p>
	    <b><a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/tusup-tucson-marriott-university-park/">Tucson Marriott University Park</a></b>: 880 E. Second St., Tucson AZ 85719. Phone: (520) 792-4100.<br>
	The Marriott is located one block north and one block west of the west entrance to the University of Arizona campus at University Blvd. & Park Ave.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    <b>McClelland Hall</b>: 1130 E. Helen St., Tucson AZ 85721.<br> 
		McClelland is located on the north side of
	    Speedway Blvd., over half a mile west of Campbell Ave.;
	    the entrance is one block to the north of Speedway, on
	    Helen. 
	  </p>

	  <h2>Walking to the lectures</h2>
	  <p>
	    Here are walking directions between the Marriott and McClelland from Google Maps:
        <ul><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zUumcduc4KvQ.kjKgzIQqlkEM" width="640" height="480"></iframe></ul>
        These directions take you east through campus and then north, passing through a pedestrian underpass underneath Speedway Ave.
        on the west side of McClelland.
	  </p>

      <h2>Parking</h2>
      <p>
        Self-parking at the Marriott is available at $13/day.  The Main Gate Garage
        is right next to the Marriott and is free on weekends and $8/day on weekdays.
      </p>

	  <p>
	    For the lectures, participants with cars may park in the Park Avenue Garage
	    immediately to the west of McClelland Hall, at the corner
	    of Park and Speedway.  Its rates are the same as the Main Gate Garage.
      </p>


	<h2>Meals</h2>
	<p>The most convenient location for meals is the area around University Blvd.
	and Park Ave., near the Marriott.  There are also some restaurants along
    Speedway Blvd.</p>

    <p>Fourth Avenue and downtown can be easily reached by the new
    <a href="http://www.sunlinkstreetcar.com">Sun Link Streetcar.</a>
    The streetcar picks up on Second St. on
    campus and on University Blvd. just south of the Marriott.  You can take it west and then
    south down Fourth Ave. to downtown Tucson, which has many nice restaurants.

      <h2>Parking</h2>
      <p>
        Self-parking at the Marriott is available at $13/day.  The Main Gate Garage
        is right next to the Marriott and is free on weekends and $8/day on weekdays.
	There is complimentary self-parking available at the Aloft.
      </p>

	  <p>
	    For the lectures, participants with cars may park in the Sixth Street Garage
	    immediately to the east of ENR2.  Its rates are the same as the Main Gate Garage.
      </p>


	<h2>Meals</h2>
	<p>The most convenient location for meals is the area around University Blvd.
	and Park Ave., near the Marriott.  There are also some restaurants along
    Speedway Blvd.  The plaza immediately to the south of the Aloft has
	a good Vietnamese restaurant as well as a Bruegger's Bagels.
	</p>

    <p>Fourth Avenue and downtown can be easily reached by the new
    <a href="http://www.sunlinkstreetcar.com">Sun Link Streetcar.</a>
    The streetcar picks up on Second St. on
    campus and on University Blvd. just south of the Marriott.  You can take it west and then
    south down Fourth Ave. to downtown Tucson, which has many nice restaurants.

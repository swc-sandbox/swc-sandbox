<h2>Arizona Winter School 2018: Iwasawa Theory</h2>

<p>
    AWS 2018 will be held March 3-7, 2018 at the
    University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ.  
<br><br>
Please note that AWS 2018 is being held <b>one week earlier</b> relative to previous Winter Schools due to a recent change
in the University of Arizona academic calendar.  This change will affect future Winter Schools as well,
so the dates for AWS 2019 will be March 2-6, 2019 (two weeks earlier ralative to tradition).
Please refer to University of Arizona <b><a href="http://www.arizona.edu/calendars-events">academic calendars</a></b> for future years.
(The AWS begins on the first day of the University of Arizona's Spring Recess in any given year.)

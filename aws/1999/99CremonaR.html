				Here is some reading for the four graduate students, based around the idea that they can get to know about conics from several points of view as a case where local-global works out nicely, which also arise in many other contexts (including 2-descent on elliptic curves, and others), and which could be used as a computer project, to try programming some algorithms for solving them.

						The first of these is still being worked on, as I have some newer ideas which improve it, so there may well be an update by March. The second shows how the solution of conics is applied to second descents on elliptic curves (with 2-torsion), including cases where a curve of genus 1 which is everywhere locally soluble is proved not to have any rational points by using conics. So this is all very much in the spirit of the School, although at first sight it is rather elementary -- but for the computational project to be at all successful, we have to keep it to something not too complicated!

				One more reference is worth including since one of the methods for solving conics involves finding the shortest vector in a 3D lattice, which one does using the LLL algorithm, is

				Another which I really should have included is the following excellent survey article by Barry Mazur in the Bull AMS. At least read the first part: he talks about the solution of conics explicitly in an early subsection.

		This year the professional development component of the Winter School will focus on some examples of the use of technology in teaching undergraduate mathematics.  There will be four 1-hour presentations:
</p>
<h2>Deborah Hughes Hallett: &#147;Mathematics for the Reluctant&#148;</h2>
<blockquote>
What mathematics and what teaching techniques are effective
in a course taken by students to fulfill a general education
mathematics requirement? This session will give a partial answer to
this question using HIV testing policies as an example. We will also
consider the role of simulation and of algebra for this audience.
</blockquote>
<h2>Shuzo Takahashi: &#147;Spreadsheet Software as a Teaching Tool for Introductory 
Mathematics Courses&#148;</h2>
<blockquote>
I will talk about one way to use 
spreadsheets in teaching mathematics, in particular, in teaching 
elementary probability theory to business majors. Other applications 
(i.e., calculus) will be briefly discussed.
</blockquote>
<h2>William V&eacute;lez: &#147;The use of the Texas
	  Instruments-Calculator Based Laboratory in the teaching of
	  calculus.&#148;</h2> 
<blockquote>
In this talk I will present several experiments that have been developed
using the TI-CBL unit in a calculus class.  This unit is extremely
portable and the data that is generated can be used to illustrate several
ideas that appear in calculus.
</blockquote>
<h2>Douglas Ulmer: &#147;A simple simulation to value stock options&#148;</h2>
<blockquote>
I will present a spreadsheet simulation (used in the University of Arizona Business Mathematics sequence) to find the fair value of certain stock options.  The underlying model is simple, in fact a little too simple: the analysis leading to the Black-Scholes formula shows that the fundamental premise of the model is incorrect.  Nevertheless, the model is useful for teaching some aspects of probability and, with a small tweak, it produces options values that are reasonably consistent with the Black-Scholes formula.

	  <h2>Driving to the lectures</h2>

	  <p>
	    Here are driving directions from Google Maps:
	    <ul>
	      <li><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=445+South+Alvernon+Way,+Tucson+AZ+85711&daddr=1130+E.+Helen+St,+Tucson+AZ&geocode=FY2R6wEdw6dj-SlTrl7bI3DWhjG6m1TW42NOkQ%3BFTPm6wEd8fdi-Sl1FmybCHHWhjG2ZDBw1gNStA&hl=en&mra=ltm&sll=32.22638,-110.931959&sspn=0.062225,0.053473&ie=UTF8&z=14">Driving from the DoubleTree to McClelland</a>
	    </ul>
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Participants with cars may park in the Park Avenue Garage
	    immediately to the west of McClelland Hall, at the corner
	    of Park and Speedway.  The garage should be free on the
	    weekend and cost $8 per day on the weekdays.  You
	    may also be able to find street parking in the
	    neighborhood to the north of McClelland.
	  </p>
	  
	<h2>Shuttle Service</h2>

	  <p>
	    Since the hotel is not within walking distance of the
	    lectures, the hotel is providing a shuttle/bus service
	    between the hotel and the lecture hall.  In the morning,
        the schedule is as follows:
        <ul>
        <li> The first bus will leave the hotel at 8 am, and other
            buses will leave when full after that.  In order to be 
            on time, we strongly recommend that you be at the lobby by 
            8:30 am.
        </ul>
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    After the lectures, the shuttle schedule is as follows:<br>
        <ul>
            <li> For those wishing to return to the hotel,
	    buses will be available in front of McClelland Hall 
        directly after the lectures, except on Monday when they will pick up
        at 1:30 PM for those not going on the Desert Museum excursion.
            <li> For those wishing to have stay longer or have dinner in the 
        university area, there will be shuttle pickups at the University Marriott
        lobby driveway at 5:30 on M-W and 6:50 on Sa-Tu. (The Marriott is just north of University Ave., behind
        Gentle Ben's.)
            <li> To be picked up at any other time, you can call the
	    main hotel switchboard at 520-881-4200.  However, <i>the scheduled
	    pickups are the only times and places for which we can guarantee
	    the prompt availability of a shuttle</i>.
        </ul>
	  </p>

	<h2>Lunch</h2>
	The most convenient location for lunch is the area around University Blvd.
	and Park Ave., about 1/2 mile SSW of McClelland Hall. There is a 
	pedestrian underpass underneath Speedway on the west side of McClelland.
	The easiest way to get to University and Park is to head south under it and
	through campus, eventually veering right to Park Ave., which you can continue 
	to follow south to University Ave.  See the map below.  
	(One can also walk towards Speedway and Campbell to the east.)

<H1>Arizona Winter School 2005
				<BR>
				Travel Information</H1>

<H2>Location</H2>
<p>AWS 2005 will take place at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Most participants will arrive by air at Albuquerque International Sunport (code ABQ).</p>

<p> The campus is located approximately two miles east of downtown Albuquerque, two miles north of the airport, and 10 miles west of the Sandia mountains, which border the eastern edge of the city.  Daytime lectures and review sessions will take place in Dane Smith Hall, room 125.</p>

<p>The official hotel of the meeting is the Wyndham hotel near the Albuquerque Airport:</p>
<blockquote>
Wyndham Albuquerque Airport<br>
2910 Yale Blvd. SE<br>
Albuquerque, NM 87106<br>
Phone: 505-843-7000<BR>
<a href="http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/ABQAP/main.wnt" target="_blank">http://www.wyndham.com/hotels/ABQAP/main.wnt</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Evening working sessions and social events will take place at the hotel.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b>  If the Southwest Center is paying for your hotel room, please do not contact the hotel directly.  See below for instructions.  If you are paying for your own hotel, you should contact the hotel by telephone and ask for the AWS rate ($72 per night).</p>

<h2>Transportation</h2>
<p>The Wyndham hotel offers a complimentary shuttle service from the airport to the hotel, available 24 hours a day.  Use the courtesy phone near the baggage claim (opposite to carrousels 2 and 5) to call the hotel.  It should take about 5 to 10 minutes for the shuttle to arrive.</p>

<p>There will be buses coming to the university in the morning and then back to the hotel in the afternoon to shuttle participants.  Bus schedules and routes will be available to the participants when they check in at the hotel.</p>

<h2>Pre-travel arrangements</h2>
<p>The University of Arizona has reserved a block of rooms at the Wyndham from the night of Friday, March 11 through the morning of Thursday, March 17 for AWS participants who are funded by the Southwest Center.  These participants must contact Sandy Braun (braun@math.arizona.edu, 520-621-4726) by <b>February 4th</b> to reserve a room.  Sandy will need to know their travel plans and roommate preferences if any.  We strongly encourage all participants to inform Sandy of their travel plans, including arrival and departure dates and local contact or hotel information.</p>

<p>
<b>VERY IMPORTANT:</b> In order to have any expenses reimbursed, you
must have the appropriate documentation and visa.  For detailed visa
information, see <a href="../../misc/local/Visas.html">this web page</a>.
For airfare reimbursement, your original passenger receipt coupon and
a photocopy of your flight itinerary will be required.  For most
people, the hotel will be paid directly by the Math Department (but
you will need a credit card or deposit for phone and incidental
charges).  The main exception is holders of F-1 visas, who will have
to pay the hotel and be reimbursed through their departments.  See the
visa page for details.  F-1 holders should plan ahead as the hotel
bill can be substantial. (Count on about ($72/night)*(6 nights) = $432
for each double room.)</p>

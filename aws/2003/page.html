<h2>About the Hotel</h2>
<p>
  This year, all Winter School activities will be held at the <a href="http://www.starwood.com/sheraton/search/hotel_detail.html?propertyID=177&amp;fromSearch=22XX&amp;linkbrand=&amp;links=all" target="_blank">Tucson Sheraton Hotel and Suites</a> (5151 E Grant Road 520-323-6262).  
  The UA Math Department has booked a block of hotel suites 
  at the hotel and for March 14-19, 
  2003 for the speakers and the participants who will be 
  receiving funding for lodging. 
  If you plan to attend and pay your own expenses, you can call
  the hotel directly to make reservations. Please be sure
  to inform them that you are an AWS participant to receive the
  conference rate. Be advised that March is a 
  very busy time for Tucson so that reservations should be
  made as early as possible.

      <h3>Lectures</h3>
      <p>
	The lectures will be held in Room N120
	of the ENR2 building, on the UA campus.  Here
	are <a href="/aws/2016/directions.html">directions</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Hotel</h3>
      <p>
	The conference hotel is the
    <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/tusup-tucson-marriott-university-park/">Tucson Marriott University Park</a>.
	Wi-Fi access is included with your room at the Marriott (if your room was booked by the SWC).
    The hotel is right next to campus and less than half a mile from the lecture hall.  Please see
	the <a href="/aws/2016/directions.html">directions page</a> for details.
      </p>

    <h3>Working sessions</h3>
      <p>
	There will be evening working sessions at 7:30 PM on Saturday,
	Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings. The working sessions
	will provide students with an opportunity to discuss their
	projects with the speakers, as well as a chance for everyone
	to get more details or clarifications from the
	speakers. Active participation by all participants is strongly
	encouraged. The evening working sessions will take place 
    in the ballroom of the Marriott. (Though the sessions
	begin at 7:30, the rooms are reserved from 6:30 PM if you wish
	to get an early start.)
      </p>
     
    <h3>Registration</h3>
      <p>
    Check-in for the conference will take place in the lobby of the Marriott Hotel on
      Friday evening from 5 PM to 8 PM, and again on campus in the lecture hall (ENR2 Room N120)
      from 8 AM to 10 AM Saturday.  You can get expense reimbursement forms and pay the banquet fee at
      this time.  You can also pay the reimbursable $125 registration fee during this time if you have not already done so,
      but please note that there will be a nonreimbursable $15 late fee if you did not pay the registration fee by March 8.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Coffee and snacks</h3>
      <p>
	Coffee and snacks will be available 30 minutes before the lectures start
	each morning and during the longer between-lecture breaks.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Banquet</h3>
      <p>
	The conference banquet will be on Wednesday, March 16 in the
	ballroom of the Marriott.  We plan for the gathering to begin at 6:00 with a
	cash bar in the foyer, followed by dinner at 6:30.  The cost is $20 for participants, thanks to a
	subsidy from the Department of Mathematics, and $40
	for guests.  Payment will be taken at check-in on Friday and Saturday. If you
	would like to attend, please
    <a href="http://bit.ly/1QRBKXP">sign up</a>

      </p>
      
      <h3>Free Afternoon</h3>
      <p>
	The afternoon of Monday, March 14 is a free afternoon.  An excursion to Sabino Canyon
    is planned.  If you would like to participate, please

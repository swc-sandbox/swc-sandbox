   <h3>Lectures</h3>
            <p>
              The lectures will be held in Room N120
              of the ENR2 building, on the UA campus.  Here
              are <a href="../../aws/2020/directions.html">directions</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Hotel</h3>
            <p>
              The conference hotel is the
          <a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/tusmp-tucson-marriott-university-park/">Tucson Marriott University Park Hotel</a>.
              Wi-Fi access is included with the room at the hotel (if your room was booked by the SWC).
          The Tucson University Park Hotel is right next to campus and less than half a mile from the lecture hall.
                 If your room was booked by the SWC, please check your lodging confirmation email, and
            see
              the <a href="../../aws/2020/directions.html">directions page</a> for more details.
            </p>

          <h3>Working sessions</h3>
            <p>
              There will be evening working sessions at 7:30 PM on Saturday,
              Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings. The working sessions
              will provide students with an opportunity to discuss their
              projects with the speakers, as well as a chance for everyone
              to get more details or clarifications from the
              speakers. Active participation by all participants is strongly
              encouraged. The evening working sessions will take place
          in the ballroom of the Tucson Marriott University Park Hotel. (Though the sessions
              begin at 7:30, the rooms are reserved from 6:30 PM if you wish
              to get an early start.)
            </p>

          <h3>Registration</h3>
            <p>
            There is a mandatory $175 registration fee to attend AWS 2020, which you can pay online
            by credit card <a href="https://aws2020.eventbrite.com">here</a>.
If you are a graduate student participant who applied for financial assistance then either this fee
will be reimbursed to you by your home institution, or the AWS will provide you with per-diem for up to $175 for the week;
please consult the funding email you were sent for details. If you are a senior participant,
then the AWS will provide you with per-diem for up to $175 for the week.

 Please note that you will not be able to check in to your hotel room unless you have paid the registration fee,
and we ask that you do so before 12:00pm MST on February 25.</p>

    <p>
    Check-in for the conference will take place in the lobby of the Tucson Marriott University Park Hotel on
      Friday evening from 5 PM to 8 PM, and again on campus in the lecture hall (ENR2 Room N120)
      from 8 AM to 10 AM Saturday.  You can get your name tag and welcome package, as well as expense reimbursement forms at these times.
      </p>

      <h3>Coffee and snacks</h3>
      <p>
        Coffee and snacks will be available 45 minutes before the lectures start
        each morning and during the longer between-lecture breaks.
      </p>

      <h3>Banquet</h3>
      <p>
        The conference banquet will be on Wednesday, March 11 in the
        ballroom of the Tucson Marriott University Park Hotel.  We plan for the gathering to begin at 6:00 with a
        cash bar in the foyer, followed by dinner at 6:30.  The cost is $30 for participants, thanks to a
        subsidy from the Department of Mathematics.
     You can pay for the banquet by credit card when you pay the registration fee

If you plan on attending, please

        on the signup page.
      </p>

    <h3>Free Afternoon</h3>
      <p>
        The afternoon of Monday, March 9 is a free afternoon.  An excursion to Sabino Canyon
    is planned.  The cost is $18, which includes round-trip transportation, and can be paid
at the same time as your registration fee <a href="https://aws2020.eventbrite.com">here</a>.

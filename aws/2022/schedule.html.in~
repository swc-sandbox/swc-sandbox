	There will be evening working sessions at 7:30 PM on Saturday,
	Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings. The working sessions
	will provide students with an opportunity to discuss their
	projects with the speakers, as well as a chance for everyone
	to get more details or clarifications from the
	speakers. Active participation by all participants is strongly
	encouraged. The evening working sessions will take place 
    in the ballroom of the Marriott. (Though the sessions
	begin at 7:30, the rooms are reserved from 6:30 PM if you wish
	to get an early start.)

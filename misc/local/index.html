Non-US citizens should consult this <a href="Visas.html">important 
information on visas and reimbursements</a>.
			</p>
<H2>Tucson</H2> 
			<P>

Tucson is located in southern Arizona, about 60 miles from
Mexico. (Here is an <A HREF="AZMap.html">overview map</A> which
shows its relation to other areas of the state.) Tucson is in the
heart of the Sonoran desert, surrounded by significant
mountains, including the 9100 foot Mount Lemmon.  As one
of the oldest settlements in North America, it enjoys a rich mix of
cultures.

			</P>
			<P>
				
The <A HREF="http://www.visittucson.org">city's website</A> is well-designed
and highly informative if you're looking for things to do or places to eat here, 
as is the <A href="http://www.tucsonguidemagazine.com/index.html">Tucson Guide</A>.
You can check out the <A HREF="http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/arizona/tucson/overview.html">New York Times</A>
travel guide for more information and interesting articles about Tucson as
well.  Try the <A HREF="http://www.arizonaguide.com/">Arizona Guide</A> site for
more information about the rest of the state.

			<IMG SRC="../gifs/Mall.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="170" ALIGN="left" ALT="UA Mall"> <H2>The University of Arizona</H2> 
			<P>

The University of Arizona was founded in 1885 with 32 students and 6
teachers. Today the University of Arizona has about 39,000 students
and about 2900 faculty members, half of whom are tenure-track or tenured. 
Its annual research grants and gifts total over $450 million.
			</P>
			<P>

The Mathematics Department of the University of Arizona has about 60
tenured or tenure-track faculty and about 55 graduate students. (There
are also about 55 graduate students in the closely related program
in applied mathematics.) The department is known for its strengths in
applied mathematics, math education research and outreach, and number
theory, among other areas.
			</P>
			<H2>Getting Here</H2> 
			<P>
The Arizona Winter School is funded by the National Science
Foundation.  NSF rules essentially require that reimbursed air flights be
<a href="Visas.html">purchased on U.S. airlines</a>.  There are some
exceptions for some European-based airlines.

The <A HREF="http://www.tucsonairport.org/">Tucson International
Airport</A> is located south of the city, only about 8 miles from the
University, and is served by six major airlines:
Alaska, American, Delta, Southwest, United, and US Airways. The simplest way to 
get to the university or a hotel is to
take a taxi, or else to use the Arizona Stagecoach van service
(520-889-1000), which has a desk in the baggage claim area.  A taxi is
about $30, and the one-way fare on Arizona Stagecoach is about $26, so
for two people going to the same destination a shared taxi is cheaper.  
The <A HREF="http://www.tucsonairport.org/">airport's
web site</A> has details on other transportation options.

			</P>
			<P>

It is also possible to fly to
Phoenix's <A HREF="http://www.phxskyharbor.com/">Sky Harbor
Airport</A> and drive or take a shuttle service to Tucson. The one-way
trip is about 100 miles and takes about 2 hours.
			</P>
			<P>

If you would like a much more leisurely mode of travel, then you might
consider Amtrak's <A HREF="http://www.texaseagle.com/">Texas Eagle</A>
service. It stops in Tucson on its way between Chicago and Los
Angeles.
			</P>
			<H2>Hotels</H2> 
			<P>

The evening sessions are currently held in the 
<a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/tusup-tucson-marriott-university-park/">Tucson Marriott University Park</A>.
For another option close to campus, consider the

			<P>
The weather in Tucson in March is quite pleasant: daytime highs are
generally in the 70's or 80's with overnight lows in the 40's. There
is only a very slight chance of rain, so you can expect blue skies.

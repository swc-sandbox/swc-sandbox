      <h2>Background</h2>
      
      <p>
	The Southwest Center for Arithmetic Geometry was founded in
	1997 with funding from an NSF Group Infrastructure Grant by
	seven mathematicians working in the southwest: Alex Buium,
	Minhyong Kim, Bill McCallum, Wayne Raskind, Dinesh Thakur, Doug
	Ulmer, and Felipe Voloch.  They were joined in 2002 by Michael
	Nakamaye, Bjorn Poonen, and Fernando Rodriguez-Villegas.  In
	2006, Matt Papanikolas, David Savitt, and William Stein joined
    Thakur and Rodriguez-Villegas as organizers, and in 2009,
    Rachel Pries joined the team, replacing Stein. From 2012 to 2015,
      the organizers were Bryden Cais, Mirela Ciperiani, Matt Papanikolas,
      Rachel Pries, and Romyar Sharifi.  Alina Bucur and David Zureick-Brown
      replaced Papanikolas and Pries in 2015. 
      The current
    organizers are Alina Bucur, Bryden Cais, Mirela Ciperiani, 
    Brandon Levin, Hang Xue, and David Zureick-Brown.  The Center is funded by 
    the National Science Foundation, with additionla support provided by the
      National Security Agency.
      
      </p>
      
      <p>
	The most important activity of the center is the annual
	Arizona Winter School, held in March at the University of
	Arizona. Winter Schools are organized in collaboration with the Clay
      Mathematics Institute.
      </p>	
      
      <h2><a name="AWS">The Arizona Winter School</a></h2>
      
      <p>
	The Arizona Winter School is an intensive five-day-long school
	in which advanced graduate students work closely with senior
	faculty and postdoctoral fellows.  In contrast to a typical conference
	at which individual researchers present their work in relative
	isolation, the AWS features a small number of extended courses
	on a set of closely related topics. The organizers work hard to
	ensure significant interaction among all participants. 
    For instance, each speaker is assigned a group of students who work
	with him or her and a postdoctoral assistant on a research project 
    during the Winter School.  These
	students present the results of their research in a
	lecture at the end of the meeting.  Other students work with
    a postdoctoral assistant in a problem session related to one or 
    more of the lecture series.  Still other students work in study groups,
    carefully learning the material from one the lecture series together.
    To facilitate work on the projects, problems, and study groups, 
    speakers, assistants, and students meet in evening working
	sessions. Participants frequently describe the AWS as a highly
	intense, but particularly productive, experience.
      </p>

      <p>
	We have written
	a <a href="../../misc/aboutSWC/AWSGuide.pdf">guide to the AWS</a> for
	participants, both speakers and students.
      </p>    
      
      <h2>Other Activities</h2> 

      <p>
	The Center previously sponsored a number of distinguished lectures
	series. Click <a href="../../dls/index.html">here</a> for more information
    and notes on these lectures. In the past, the grant has
	provided summer support for graduate students, travel,
	and computers, including the server that hosts this
	site. It also supported an AMS special
	session, &#147;Graduate and postdoctoral education: The Arizona Winter School,&#148;
	in January 2001 in New Orleans.
      </p>

      <h2>The Directors of the Center</h2> 
      <p>
	The Southwest Center has one Director and five co-Directors.  They are:

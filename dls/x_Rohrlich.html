<h3>David Rohrlich: Crosscurrents in Galois theory</h3>

Rohrlich gave a series of 4 lectures in December, 2000 about connections between the inverse Galois problem and division towers (both the usual and &#147;false&#148; division towers). Many of these results appear in two papers in the Journal of Algebra: <a href="http://www.idealibrary.com/cgi-bin/links/citation/0021-8693/229/249" target="_blank">False division towers of elliptic curves</a> and <a href="http://www.idealibrary.com/cgi-bin/links/citation/0021-8693/229/280" target="_blank">A deformation of the Tate module</a>.

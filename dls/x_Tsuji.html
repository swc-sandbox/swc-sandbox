<h3>Takeshi Tsuji: p-adic Hodge theory and arithmetic</h3>

Tsuji gave a series of 4 lectures at USC and Caltech in February, 2001 on various topics related to p-adic Hodge theory. He provided 2 sets of notes, on &#147;Explicit reciprocity law for Lubin-Tate groups&#148; (<a href="../dls/DLSTsuji1.dvi">dvi</a>, <a href="../dls/DLSTsuji1.ps">ps</a>, <a href="../dls/DLSTsuji1.pdf">pdf</a>) and on &#147;Crystalline sheaves, syntomic cohomology, and p-adic polylogarithms&#148; (<a href="../dls/DLSTsuji2.dvi">dvi</a>, <a href="../dls/DLSTsuji2.ps">ps</a>, <a href="../dls/DLSTsuji2.pdf">pdf</a>).

<h3>Anand Pillay: Model theory and diophantine geometry</h3>

Pillay gave a very intense and very instructive series of 5 lectures in May 2000. Notes by Robert Lakatos are available in <a href="../dls/DLSPillay.ps">ps</a> and <a href="../dls/DLSPillay.pdf">pdf</a> formats. These notes contain a few inaccuracies and should be considered as a preliminary draft, but they may be useful as an introduction to the model-theoretic proof of the Mordell-Lang conjecture.
